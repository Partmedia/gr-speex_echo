Wrapper for speex_echo_cancellation in libspeexdsp

    in - Signal from the microphone (near end + far end echo)
    echo - Signal played to the speaker (received from far end)
    out - Near-end signal with echo removed 

frame_size is the amount of data (in samples) you want to process at once. It is recommended to use a frame size in the order of 20 ms (or equal to the codec frame size) and make sure it is easy to perform an FFT of that size (powers of two are better than prime sizes).

filter_length is the length (in samples) of the echo cancelling filter you want to use (also known as tail length). The recommended tail length is approximately the third of the room reverberation time.
